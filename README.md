# Covid_19

## Overview of Project

The objective of this project is to have an overview of the numbers of Covid-19 infections, deaths and vaccinations around the world until January 2022. This work will be divided into three segments, world, continents and countries. 

Note: The results of this project are entirely based on the numbers contained in the dataset and has no intentions of evaluating the actions taken by governments and/or effectiveness of vaccines. This work is based on the assumption that all countries involved in this analysis reported their numbers in the same way.

Covid- 19 Worldwide:
*	Percentage of population infected worldwide.
*	Percentage of deaths worldwide.
*	Percentage of population vaccinated worldwide.

Continents:
*	Percentage of population infected per continent.
*	Percentage of population infected per continent.
*	Percentage of vaccination per continent.
*	Percentage of death per cases per continent.

Countries:
*	Top 10 countries per total cases.
*	Top 10 countries by population infected.
*	Top 10 countries by vaccinations.
*	Top 10 countries by deaths.

### Covid worldwide

5.6 million people from the 366 million infected have died from the virus infection representing 1.5 percent from the total number of people infected.

The total number of vaccinated in the world is 4.6 billion which represents 60% of the world’s population.

Worldwide the total deaths caused by covid 19 represents 0.07% of the world’s population.

The chart below shows that the number of deaths has been decreasing since the introduction of vaccines, however the total number of cases has increased 3 times when compared to 2020.

### Covid per continent
Europe, Asia and North America represent the continents with more Covid cases. However, when one considers the percentage of population infected, Asia is the continent with less cases, having 1.85 percent of its population infected. Rearranging the continents by percentage of cases, Europe is the continent with the higher percentage of cases, followed by North America and South America. The difference between the first place and last can be challenged by a range of factors as how each country reported their numbers, quantity of tested people, NIPs in place (Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions) and other variables.

Africa’s lower case total cannot be justifyed by its level of vaccinations as the continent shows a low percentage of its population that is vaccinated. Africa has 16% of its poplation vaccinated which represent a significant difference when compared with the continent in first place by percentage of population vaccinated, South America.

### Percentage of deaths per case by continent:

The percentage of deaths by continent do not correlate with the percentage of total cases (more cases more deaths). Although South America is the number one in percentage of vaccination, and number three in percentage of cases per population, when it comes to percentage of deaths it is the continent leading this category followed by Africa which has the lowest percentage of cases.

The chart below shows the total number of cases per month since 2020. Europe and North America are the continents where the number of cases started to increase on November, December and January based on the last two years of data.

## Summary

The data shows that less than 0.07 percent of the world’s population has died from the virus, this the percentage of deaths increases to 1.5 percent when compared with the total cases of infection. Overall, the data shows that the chances of dying from Covid-19 are low.
The continents with the highest percentage of infection are Europe, North America and South America. Although South America is the leading continent in vaccinations, having 77% of its population is vaccinated, it is also the leading continent in deaths per case. From the total population infected, 2.5 percent has died, which is higher than the world’s death percentage by cases. 
In spite of being the first country in the top 10 countries by total death in 2021, The United States was able to maintain almost the same number of deaths when compared with 2020. Brazil, India and Russia (second, third and fourth place) had the number of deaths doubled in 2021. United Kingdom and Italy were the two countries that were able to reduce the number of deaths in 2021 within this category.
